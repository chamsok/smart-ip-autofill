# Privacy Policy for Smart IP AutoFill Chrome Extension

**Last Updated:** January 2025

## Overview

Smart IP AutoFill ("we," "our," or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our Chrome extension.

## Information We Collect

### Data Collected Locally
- **Form Data**: Information you choose to save in autofill profiles (names, addresses, etc.)
- **User Preferences**: Extension settings and configuration
- **Authentication Data**: Google OAuth tokens for secure login

### Data NOT Collected
- We do NOT collect, store, or transmit your personal data to external servers
- We do NOT track your browsing history
- We do NOT sell or share your data with third parties

## How We Use Your Information

### Local Storage Only
- All form data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's secure storage API
- Data is encrypted and tied to your Google account for security
- No data leaves your device except for Google authentication

### Google Authentication
- We use Google OAuth solely for secure user authentication
- Only basic profile information (email, name) is accessed for account identification
- Authentication tokens are stored securely and used only for login purposes

## Data Security

### Protection Measures
- All data is stored locally using Chrome's encrypted storage
- Google OAuth provides secure authentication
- No external data transmission except for authentication
- User data is isolated per account (no cross-user access)

### Data Retention
- Form data persists until you manually delete profiles
- Authentication tokens expire and refresh automatically
- You can clear all data by removing the extension

## Permissions Explanation

### Why We Need Broad Permissions
- **All URLs Access**: Required to detect and fill forms on any website you choose to use
- **Active Tab**: Needed to interact with forms on the current webpage
- **Storage**: Essential for saving your autofill profiles locally
- **Identity**: Required for secure Google authentication

### How Permissions Are Used
- Form detection and filling only occurs when you actively use the extension
- No background data collection or monitoring
- Permissions are used solely for the extension's core functionality

## Your Rights and Controls
